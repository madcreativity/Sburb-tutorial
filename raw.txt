Init.xml
The first file you'll see when opening the "levels" folder is the "init.xml" file. This file is automatically set to run on startup (unless you change it in index.html) and basically surves as the entry point to your walkaround. It's where you choose what room should be loaded first, which asset path you're using (where your images are relative to the main folder) and what dependencies all your rooms need. Your file is probably already set up to load the things it needs to, though. No need to worry about this right now so just don't mess with it.



The structure of a SBURBML file
Before you really get into working with SBURBML, you need to know the basic structure of a SBURBML file.




Download the SBURB engine from https://github.com/WhatPumpkin/Sburb and unzip the zip file anywhere on your computer.


Creating production version
The jsmin file in the current version of the SBURB engine is not functional so download it from http://crockford.com/javascript/jsmin, move the exe file from the zip and to the folder where the other jsmin file is and then delete the jsmin file that's not an executable.

(Windows)
Intall Cygwin from https://cygwin.com/install.html and make sure that the zip and bzip2 packages are both set to the newest versions and that the bin's are included.

Run Cygwin (if you're on Windows) and navigate to the SBURB files using the "cd" command.
For example, if my folder was C:/Users/Mad/sburb, I'd do the following:
"cd C:"
"cd Users"
"cd Mad"
"cd sburb"

Once you're there, type "batch production.sh". It might ask you if you want to delete index.html or index_dev.html. You're free to type either "y" or "n" ("yes" or "no", respectively).
This should create a zip file called "Sburb.zip". Congratulatious, you now have a production version that you can upload to the internet.
