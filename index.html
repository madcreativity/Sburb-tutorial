                        <h2>Creating production version</h2>
                        <p>
                            Creating a production version of your walkaround is important if you want to publish it. It basically compresses all the code and makes it faster to load.
                            The jsmin file in the current version of the SBURB engine is not functional so download it from <a href="http://crockford.com/javascript/jsmin" target="_blank">http://crockford.com/javascript/jsmin</a> move the exe file from the zip and to the folder where the other jsmin file is and then delete the jsmin file that's not an executable.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            (Windows)<br>
                            Intall Cygwin from <a href="https://cygwin.com/install.html" target="_blank">https://cygwin.com/install.html</a> and make sure that the zip and bzip2 packages are both set to the newest versions and that the bin's are included.
                            Run Cygwin (if you're on Windows) and navigate to the SBURB files using the "cd" command.
                            For example, if my folder was C:/Users/Mad/sburb, I'd do the following:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"cd C:"</li>
                            <li>"cd Users"</li>
                            <li>"cd Mad"</li>
                            <li>"cd sburb"</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Once you're there, type "batch production.sh". It might ask you if you want to delete index.html or index_dev.html. Typing "y" and pressing enter is all you really need to do.
                            This should create a zip file called "Sburb.zip". Congratulatious, you now have a production version that you can upload to the internet.
                        </p>
