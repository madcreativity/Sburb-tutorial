                            <p>
                                Setting up is really simple since you only need a text editor, a browser and the files from the Github page, but I'll write it down anyway since some people may have difficulties. First off, open the <a href="https://github.com/WhatPumpkin/Sburb" target="_blank">Github page</a>. There should be a green button labeled "Clone or download". Push that button and then click the "Download ZIP" button.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When the file is done downloading, find the ZIP and extract its contents in a folder on your computer. I would also suggest downloading either <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.6.4.html" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> to make the files easier to work with and read, though.
                            </p>

                        <section class="notes">
                            <h2>Notes</h2>
                            <p>
                                While developing your walkaround, please remember that all names are case sensitive. For example, "SamPle-folDer" is not the same as "sample-folder".
                            </p>
                        </section>

                    <section id="development">
                        <h1>Development</h1>
                        <section id="init-xml">
                            <h2>Init.xml</h2>
                            <p>
                                The first file you'll see when opening the "levels" folder is the "init.xml" file. This file is automatically set to run on startup (unless you change it in index.html) and basically surves as the entry point to your walkaround. It's where you choose what room should be loaded first, which asset path you're using (where your images are relative to the main folder) and what dependencies all your rooms need. Your file is probably already set up to load the things it needs to, though. No need to worry about this right now so just don't mess with it.

                            </p>

                            <h2>Creating production version</h2>
                            <p>
                                Creating a production version of your walkaround is important if you want to publish it. It basically compresses all the code and makes it faster to load.
                                The jsmin file in the current version of the SBURB engine is not functional so download it from <a href="http://crockford.com/javascript/jsmin" target="_blank">here</a>. Move the exe file from the ZIP and to the folder where the other jsmin file is and then delete the old jsmin file.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                (Windows)<br>
                                Intall <a href="https://cygwin.com/install.html" target="_blank">Cygwin</a>, make sure that the "zip" and "bzip2" packages are both set to the newest versions and that the bin's are included.
                                Run Cygwin (if you're on Windows) and navigate to the SBURB files using the "cd" command.
                                For example, if my folder was C:/Users/Mad/sburb, I'd do the following:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>"cd C:"</li>
                                <li>"cd Users"</li>
                                <li>"cd Mad"</li>
                                <li>"cd sburb"</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Once you're there, type "batch production.sh". It might ask you if you want to delete index.html or index_dev.html. You're free to type either "y" or "n" ("yes" or "no", respectively).
                                This should create a ZIP file called "sburb.zip". Congratulations; You now have a production version that can be uploaded to the internet.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Embedding on external sites</h2>
                            <p>
                                Now that you've made your production version, you probably want to use it in an adventure on <a href="https://mspfa.com" target="_blank">MSFPA</a> or on some other website. To do this, first upload all the files and folders within the sburb.zip file, but not the zip file itself. You want a host that allows for any file format, correct folder structures and direct links to files. For this, I would suggest Miroware's <a href="https://miroware.io/pipe/" target="_blank">Pipe</a> as it fullfills all these criteria and is developed by the current owner of MSPFA.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To embed your walkaround on <italic>any</italic> website, simply replace copy the following copy and replace the example link with the direct link to your own HTML file. You can then use the edited code on any website that allows HTML insertion and iframe not-same-origin access (including MSPFA). If this code does not work, it is either because the website does not support HTML/iframes or that your file link is not a direct link the HTML file.
                            </p>
                            <pre>
                                <code>&lt;iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://pipe.miroware.io/3xAmpl3/example.html"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code>
